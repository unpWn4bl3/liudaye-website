Next.js 13 introduces several groundbreaking features that revolutionize how we build web applications. The new app directory structure, along with React Server Components, provides an intuitive and powerful way to create modern web applications.

## Key Features

### App Directory
The app directory introduces a more intuitive project structure with built-in support for layouts, loading states, and error handling.

### React Server Components
Server Components allow us to render complex components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size and improving initial page load performance.

### Improved Data Fetching
Next.js 13 provides new patterns for data fetching that work seamlessly with Server Components and the app directory structure.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 13 project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
```

This command sets up a new project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the new app directory structure.
